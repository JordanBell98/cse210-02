# Cards
This game is about guessing whether the next card has a higher or lower number than 
the current card. The game is easy, all you have to do is read the given card value (1-13) 
and determine whether or not the next card drawn will be higher or lower than the 
current one. You will earn or lose points depending of your answer.
